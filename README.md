Project: Geothermal Dorm Project
Description: An application created for Alejandro Martinez for his geothermal dorm HVAC system on Southeastern's campus. This application is 
             designed to show how the system works and give users information and data about the system. This site is purely HTML, CSS, 
             JavaScript, and PHP with the model being made in Blendr. This site utilizes the Three.js library to diplay the 3D model. 
             
Site Status: Complete

Project Installation Recommendation: To look at the project code more effectively, I recommend using Visual Studio Code and 
                                     installing the Live Server Extension to view the project locally.
                                     Hosting the project was done through Heroku during presentations, and after project completetion hosting
                                     was turned over to the university.
